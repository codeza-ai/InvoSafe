## About the project
I’ve built Vyayam, an intuitive invoice management app, using Next.js and a suite of amazing tools from Vercel. This project has been an incredible introduction to the Next.js framework and has helped me gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools.

Here’s a quick rundown of the stack I used:

✨ NextAuth for seamless authentication

💾 Vercel Storage for managing data

💻 App Routing for organized navigation

🎨 Tailwind CSS for sleek, responsive styling

🛠 Figma to craft the UI

🧹 ESLint to ensure clean and efficient code

Building Vyayam has been a fantastic learning experience, giving me insight into building real-world applications from the ground up. I’m looking forward to improving it further and would love to hear any feedback or suggestions you might have!
